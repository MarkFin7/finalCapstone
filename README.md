## Capstone Project VII - Unsupervised Machine Learning

This projecrt uses a dataset from the US Arrests Kaggle challenge. A description of the data is given as: “This data set contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents, for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Also given is the percent of the population living in urban areas.”

The project attempts to create a detailed, in-depth PCA report of the data, exploring the dataset before we can do any real work on it. 
It then has an application of two clustering techniques and an analysis of the clusters they generate.

2. Usage of the workbook

## Installation
This project will require you to install python and jupyter notebook on your local machine
To install python on a windows machine go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
and follow the instructions there.

To install jupyter notebook locally:

Installing Jupyter with pip
  First, ensure that you have the latest pip; older versions may have trouble with some dependencies:
    pip3 install --upgrade pip
  Then install the Jupyter Notebook using:
    pip3 install jupyter
    
Once you have installed Jupyter, you can start the notebook server from the command line:
  jupyter notebook
This will print some information about the notebook server in your terminal, including the URL of the web application. The notebook will then open in your browser.

## Usage
Once the dependencies are installed and the jupyter notebook is open then you can run it sequentially. Click into each cell in turn and click ctrl + Enter to run that cell.
